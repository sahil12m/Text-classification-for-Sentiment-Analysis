# Text-classification-for-Sentiment-Analysis

The project involves building machine learning models and deep learning models to tackle the sentiments of reviews from Amazon reviews dataset which contains real reviews for office products sold on Amazon.

The project is divided into 2 parts:

1) The 1st part involves feature extraction using TF-IDF and Bag of Words(BOW) and build 4 ML models to detect classify the review based on sentiment. The models used are namely : Perceptron, SVM, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes(HW1-CSCI544.ipynb). The pdf file has the report for the 1st part of the code (Sahil_Mondal_HW1_CSCI544.pdf).

2) The 2nd part involves using self-trained word embeddings and the "word2vec-google-news-300" pre-trained word embeddings for feature extraction. The models used in this code are Perceptron and SVM to compare accuracies with previous feature extraction techniques, Feed Forward Neural Networks and 3 types of Recurrent Neural Networks (Simple RNN, Gated RNN, LSTM). The pdf file has the report for the 2nd part of the code (HW3-Sahil-Mondal.pdf).
